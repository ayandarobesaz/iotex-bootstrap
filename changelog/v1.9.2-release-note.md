# v1.9.2 Release Note

## Summary
v1.9.2 is a maintenance release, with the following fix:

1. Limit the maximum size of RPC response data to prevent node from running out
of memory.

## Upgrade Priority
If your node is running as gateway, it is recommended to upgrade to v1.9.2 to
better protect it from potential out-of-memory attack.

| ---------- | ------------ |
| Delegate   | Not required |
| Gateway    | Recommended  |
| Fullnode   | Not required |
